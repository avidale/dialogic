These examples show how to use VK API without the rest of `tgalice`.

When creating this interface, I intended it to be similar to 
https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.

To attach a bot to your own VK group, you should register it. 
The instruction is given by 
https://vk.com/dev/bots_docs.

Before running the scripts, you should set two environment variables, 
`VK_TOKEN` and `VK_GROUP_ID`.
